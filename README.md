# DevDayDemo2018  

This is a simple set of commits meant to act as an aid to my LINE Dev Day 2018 presentation, *📖 UPGRADING EMOJI: SECRETS🤫 TO CODING YOUR OWN🎨*.  

In short, they provide steps for displaying LINE Corp’s custom emoji in various formats. 

## Licensing  

**Please note** that the licensing for the code and the images used in the demonstration are *different*:

- Images are property of LINE Corp and must follow the guidelines and usage found [here](https://line.me/en/logo). As an alternative, a pdf copy of the guidlines is bundled with the images. 

- All other assets in this repository fall under the Apache 2.0 license.  

## Warning Regarding Usage  

This code was created as a demo and companion to a set presentation, and therefore is not necessarily “production ready.” Among other things, it may lack error handling and bounds checking.
